## Vector Database
- A Vector Database is used to store unstructured data.
  - Types of unstructured data: 🖼️ Images, 🎥 Videos, 🎵 Audio, 📝 Text...
  - Unstructured data is converted into high-dimensional vectors (embeddings), which means converting it into numerical array form. 🔢
  - Embedding models like language transformers and vision transformers are used to convert unstructured data into numerical arrays. 🤖🔍
  - High-dimensional vectors can be saved in Vector Databases such as:
    - Pinecone 🌲
    - Chroma 🌈
    - Weaviate 🧠
    - FAISS 📊 

## What are Embeddings?
A vector database stores not only the original data (which could be images, audio, or text), but also its encoded form: embeddings. These embeddings are essentially lists of numbers (i.e., vectors) that store contextual representations of the data. Intuitively, when we refer to an “embedding”, we are talking about a compressed, low-dimensional representation of data (images, text, audio) that actually exists in higher dimensions.
