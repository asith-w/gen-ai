		- Types of unstructured data: 🖼️ Images, 🎥 Videos, 🎵 Audio, 📝 Text...
		- Unstructured data is converted into high-dimensional vectors (embeddings), which means converting it into numerical array form. 🔢
		- Embedding models like language transformers and vision transformers are used to convert unstructured data into numerical arrays. 🤖🔍
		- High-dimensional vectors can be saved in Vector Databases such as:
		  - Pinecone 🌲
